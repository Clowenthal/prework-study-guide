            <li>A blob (binary large object) is the content of a file. Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata (A blob's name internally is a hash of its content.)</li>

            <li>A tree object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names</li>

            <li>A commit object links tree objects together into history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a timestamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.</li>

            <li>A tag object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a digital signature of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git</li>
            
            <li>A packfile object collects various other objects into a zlib-compressed bundle for compactness and ease of transport over network protocols.</li>
